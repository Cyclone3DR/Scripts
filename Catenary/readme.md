# Catenary inspection

This script computes deviations between the catenary (3d polyline) and the railway axis (3d polyline). The deviations are projected in the local rail coordinate systems to make the result independant from superelevation (Track axis is its origin, rails plane stands for Xaxis, track axis direction for Yaxis and height above the rails for Zaxis).

To use the scripts, open or import the 4 polylines (catenary, 3d track axis, left and right rails), and load js file. Then run the script like if you were running a Cyclone3DR command. Fill parameters in the dialog box and click OK. Created points will be saved in a csv file.
