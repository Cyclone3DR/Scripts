# Volume_Tank_Angle

The aim of this script is to compute the volume of liquid above and under a certain level in a tanker boat that is moving, so its orientation along X and Y is changing (the rod, where the level is read, is not vertical since the boat is moving).

To use this script, simply select the mesh and launch it. You need to enter the parameters in the dialog box, then click ok to start the computation. At the end of the computation, the script will save all the results in a CSV file.
