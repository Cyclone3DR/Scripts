# Tank inspection

2 scripts to extract measurement points on tank mesh(es):

- create points at a radius in an angular increment on a mesh: useful for creating inspection points on a tank floor to inspect settlement
- create points onto the shell of a tank at angular increments

To use the scripts, open the script editor and load js file, import your mesh(es), select it and run the script like if you were running a Cyclone3DR command. Fill parameters in the dialog box and click OK. Created points will be saved in a csv file.
