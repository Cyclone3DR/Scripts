# Cloud_sections

The aim of this script is to segment a point cloud according to cross-sections (or planar polylines). 

To use this script, simply select the cloud and the polylines and launch the script. You need to enter a threeshold corresponding to the half thickness of the slices. Note that one cloud will be created per polyline.
