# My first script

The purpose of My First Script is a tutorial to help beginners in scripting in Cyclone 3DR to get on board easily. This script offers a list of common scripting functions in order to achieve basic Cyclone 3DR tasks.

My First Script outlines a way to make the following features automatic:
-	Opening an existing 3DR project
-	Easy selection of an object in the scene as input of the script
-	Creation of a basic mesh from a point cloud
-	Creation of a pop-up dialog to require user parameters
-	Modification of object parameters (name, color, transparency)
-	Extraction of planar sections along the vertical axis
-	Inspection between a point cloud and a mesh
-	Extraction of the best plane of an object
-	Creation of a label
-	Exporting a textured mesh in OBJ format to a user-defined folder


To use the script, open the given .3dr file, and load js file. Then run the script like if you were running a Cyclone3DR command.
